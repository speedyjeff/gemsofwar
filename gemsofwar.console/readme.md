### Gems of War Command Line tool

The command line tool companion is critical for training and optimizing the models in conjunction with [gemsofwar.window](https://github.com/speedyjeff/gemsofwar/blob/master/gemsofwar.window/readme.md).

The tool has detailed command line usage below.

```
./gemsofwar.console [help|-?|evaluate|evolve|createboard|dumpboard|play|check]

    * train -path <path> -output <filename>
      trains a model given an input of .dmp and .dat files
         input for training is generated by running gemesofwar.window
    * evaluate -input <filename>
      evaluates a model given a json file of training data
    * evolve -input <filename> -population <number> -generations <number>
      uses a genetic algorithm to find the optimal settings given
      a json file of training dat
       defaults -
         population  : 100
         generations : 10
    * check -path <path> -input <filename>
      loads the model and checks the .dmp with the .dat files
         input for training is generated by 'train'

    * createboard -dimension <number> -gemcount <number>
      iterates all possible boards given a dimension and number of possible gem values
       warning -
         this action will write a lot of data to disk and may run forever
    * dumpboard -input <filename> -skip <number> -take <number>
      dump the generated boards created by createboard

    * play -mode [battle|treasure]
      play a round of gemsofwar
